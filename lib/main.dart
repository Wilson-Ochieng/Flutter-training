//The code provided is a minimal Dart program containing only the `main` function. In Dart, the `main` function serves as the entry point for any application. When you run a Dart program, execution begins with the `main` function. This is similar to the `main` function in other programming languages like C, C++, or Java.
//The syntax `void main()` indicates that the function does not return any value (`void` is the return type). The parentheses `()` suggest that the function does not take any parameters. Inside the curly braces `{ }`, you would typically include the code that defines the behavior of your program. However, in this case, the body of the `main` function is empty, meaning the program does nothing when executed.
//This is a valid Dart program, but it is essentially a placeholder or starting point. You can add logic, function calls, or other operations inside the `main` function to build out your application. For example, you might print a message to the console, initialize variables, or call other functions from here.
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Container(
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
              gradient: LinearGradient(
                  colors: [const Color.fromARGB(205, 2, 78, 210),const Color.fromARGB(255, 212, 181, 6)])),
          child: const Center(
            child: Text('Hello World Now with Flutter!'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
